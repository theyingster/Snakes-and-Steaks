# Snakes-and-Steaks

This is an independent project created by me under the guidance of Jeff Hsu. The project simulates the snake game but with the twist that the snake is collecting steak pieces to grow. There are also pills that spawn once in a while that reduce the snake length. 

The link to the game is https://snakes-and-steaks.gitlab.io/snake.

Have fun!
